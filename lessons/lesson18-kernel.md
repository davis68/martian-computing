![](../img/18-header-verne2.png)

It's time for a philosophical fireside chat.  To tie together our loose ends up to this point, and to preface our further dive into the kernel post-Gall, we need to read the Urbit Whitepaper and thoroughly discuss its perspective.  We will also need to re-read and internalize the Urbit Precepts (an aesthetic of programming) and their associated discussion.
